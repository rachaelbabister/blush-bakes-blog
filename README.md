# BLUSH BAKES BY RACH | RECIPE BLOG


Welcome to the Recipe Blog by Blush Bakes by Rach. Utilising the existing branding and style from my business website, I've built this blog with a focus on elegant simplicity, wanting to share my baking passion with a wider audience.

Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python using the Django framework, this blog offers a responsive experience across all devices, whether on your desktop, tablet, or phone -  the content is easy to navigate and visually appealing.

As a visitor to the site, you'll find a diverse selection of baking recipes, ranging from cakes and cupcakes to biscuits and brownies. You're invited to register an account, enabling you to engage with the community by commenting on recipes and sharing your own baking experiences.

One of the highlights of this blog is the ability to save your favourite recipes directly to your profile, giving easy access to the recipes at a later date.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website came from the colours that were used in the main Blush Bakes by Rach website.

![Blush Bakes by Rach colour palette](readmefiles/images/ux/colour-palette.png)

### Typography

- Reenie Beenie: A cursive font used for headings throughout the website, offering a touch of elegance that resonates with the branding and logo aesthetics.
- Raleway: A clean sans-serif font, with good legibility for the main body text, giving a modern appearance for easy reading, enhancing the overall user experience. 

![Google Fonts used by Blush Bakes by Rach](readmefiles/images/ux/googlefonts.png)

Font Awesome is also used for the 'back to top' arrow on the website and the comments icon.

### Imagery

The type of imagery used on the website is all photography. The logo was designed by me, and the main header photo was taken by myself. The recipe photo's have been taken from Google search and are referenced in Credits.

### Wireframes

Before implementing the website, I created Wireframes for each page using Balsamiq. You can access them [here](README/images/wireframes).

#### Home Page

The home page features a bright hero image of some cupcakes and a treat box directly underneath the navigational header. There is some welcome text underneath, which introduces the baker and where they're based.

The next section is broken down into images and text, to showcase some of the cakes and treat boxes, and gives the user ideas as to what they can order and for who.

Just above the footer there is another image banner with a call to action to take you to the contact page.

#### Gallery

In this top section below the menu header, it starts by asking if the user needs inspiration and to take a look at the gallery. There are 3 anchor links (cakes, cupcakes and treat boxes) which when clicked take you to the appropriate part of the gallery.

The same call to action banner is also at the bottom above the footer.

#### Contact

To bring some colour and interest to this page there is a colourful cake banner image below the menu section. It invites users to get in touch using the contact form. Some elements are required before the form can be submitted, and users do get alerted when they haven't filled in these elements.

#### Thank You

A simple page with the same styling as the Contact page. The form elements have been removed and replaced with a 'thank you for submitting' message.

### Future Implementations

- A new page with standard pricing and examples of cakes and their pricing.
- An information page giving users cake care and cutting guides.
- A suppliers page - recommendations of where to buy supplies.
- A 'recipe' page which details flavours available for sponge and fillings, and what options of treat boxes are available.
What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

I have tried to ensure the site has been made as accessible as possible by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using alt attributes on images where available.
- Adding aria-labels for screen labels.
- Using colour contrasts between the text and background.

## Testing

I have learnt from this project to ensure I start my TESTING file from the begining in future. I continually test the site as I go along and have fixed many small issues that didn't work straight away, but unfortunately these weren't catalogued.

In the TESTING file linked below, you can see the tests and fixes I did manage to catalogue.
